# Charbel-ICO

Charbel ICO is my demo token that i launched using a Ropsten address. The Token address is 0x591a6FD4E95a9e8936B26b052714EceEF6646BC8 and is called Last Last since it took me more than once to get it right.

The codes are located in the contract folder. They're solidity contracts launched using remix.

RegularICO contract has a timer of one week whereas the other ICO contract just accepts your ether and send you my token.

This is by no means an actual ICO contract since i created it just to grasp the idea of how contracts are made and launched. It also helped me understand how to start developing decetnralized applications.
